BLINK DB Part-B: TCP Server and RESP-2 Interface Design Document

1. Overview:
   - Extend storage engine with a network interface.
   - Implements a TCP server that communicates using Redis RESP-2 protocol.
   - Handles multiple clients using I/O multiplexing (epoll on Linux / kqueue on macOS/BSD).

2. Connection Management:
   - Chose epoll/kqueue for scalability (efficiently supports thousands of connections).
   - Alternatives (e.g., threads) were considered but rejected due to overhead.

3. RESP-2 Protocol:
   - Implements minimal RESP-2 encoding/decoding to support SET, GET, DEL commands.
   - Uses simple text parsing for commands.

4. Benchmarking:
   - Plans to use redis-benchmark to evaluate performance.
   - Benchmark tests will include 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 concurrent requests over 10, 100, and 1000 connections respectively.
