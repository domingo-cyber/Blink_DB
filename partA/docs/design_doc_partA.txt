BLINK DB Part-A: Storage Engine Design Document

1. Overview:
   - In-memory key-value store.
   - Implements SET, GET, DEL.
   - REPL interface for testing.

2. Data Structures:
   - Uses std::unordered_map for O(1) access.
   - Mutex protection (for thread safety, though REPL is single-threaded).

3. Eviction Policy:
   - (Optional enhancement) Describe potential eviction (e.g., LRU) if capacity is reached.
   - Trade-offs discussed between simplicity and performance.

4. Workload Optimization:
   - Optimized for balanced workload (reads and writes are similar).
